# 🍕 Wheels of Cheese – Sales Performance & Revenue Intelligence Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

Wheels of Cheese is a fictional pizza company operating across multiple product categories and sizes.
The leadership team wanted to understand **what drives revenue, which products customers prefer, and where business opportunities exist**.

As a Data Analyst, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard to transform raw order data into **decision-ready insights**.

This project demonstrates how data can be used to monitor KPIs, identify sales patterns, and support smarter operational and marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Despite having strong sales, management did not have clear visibility into:

* Which pizza categories generate the highest revenue
* How ordering behavior changes by day and month
* What sizes customers prefer
* Which individual products are top performers
* Whether the average order value is healthy

Without this clarity, pricing, promotions, and inventory planning were largely guesswork.

---

## 🧠 My Objective

Build a centralized analytics view that would:

✔ Track core performance metrics
✔ Reveal customer purchase behavior
✔ Identify best & worst performing products
✔ Enable filtering by time, category, and size
✔ Help leadership make data-backed decisions

## 📊 KPI Snapshot (from the dashboard)

* **Total Revenue:** 68.23K
* **Total Orders:** 1,773
* **Total Pizzas Sold:** 4,107
* **Average Order Value:** 38.48

These KPIs instantly communicate overall business health.

## 🔍 Key Insights Discovered

### 1️⃣ Revenue is concentrated in specific categories

Supreme and Classic pizzas contribute the largest share of revenue, closely followed by Chicken, while Veggie generates comparatively lower sales.

👉 This indicates strong customer inclination toward premium and traditional options.

---

### 2️⃣ A few products drive a large portion of sales

Items like:

* California Chicken
* Thai Chicken
* Barbecue Chicken

consistently rank at the top.

👉 A small product group is responsible for a significant percentage of total revenue (Pareto effect).

---

### 3️⃣ Daily sales fluctuations reveal demand patterns

Order trends across days show noticeable peaks and drops.

👉 This can help in:

* staff scheduling
* kitchen preparation
* targeted weekday promotions

---

### 4️⃣ Average Order Value provides upsell opportunities

With AOV around **38**, bundles, meal deals, or add-ons could be introduced to increase per-customer spending.

---

### 5️⃣ Size preference impacts inventory planning

By filtering across sizes (S to XXL), management can anticipate dough, ingredient, and packaging requirements.

---

## 💼 Business Recommendations
Based on analysis, I would suggest:
✅ Promote high-performing pizzas in ads & combos
✅ Create offers to improve Veggie category sales
✅ Run targeted discounts on low-demand days
✅ Design upsell strategies to raise AOV
✅ Stock inventory aligned with popular sizes & categories
